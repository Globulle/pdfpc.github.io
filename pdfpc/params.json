{"name":"pdfpc","tagline":"A presenter console with multi-monitor support for PDF files.","body":"# About\r\n\r\npdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application for GNU/Linux which uses Keynote like multi-monitor output to provide meta information to the speaker during the presentation. It is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen, while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other one providing information like a picture of the next slide, as well as the left over time till the end of the presentation. The input files processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, which can be created using nearly any of today's presentation software.\r\n\r\n# Screenshots\r\n\r\n![pdfpc in action](http://pdfpc.github.io/pdfpc/screenshot1-thumb.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\nThe most relevant features of pdfpc are:\r\n\r\n- Shows current and next\r\n- Support for (textual or LaTeX beamer) notes\r\n- Support for overlays (e.g. as generated by the beamer LaTeX package)\r\n- Timer or countdown showing remaining time in the presentation\r\n- Overview mode for quick switching between slides\r\n- Freezing and turning off the presentation view\r\n- Customizable keybindings, enabling support for different presenter devices\r\n- Video playback support\r\n\r\nSee the man page for more details.\r\n\r\nTo get a better feeling of pdfpc, install it, download the demo presentation and start it with\r\n\r\n    pdfpc pdfpc-demo.pdf\r\n\r\n# News\r\n\r\n- February 2015: fork from davvil/pdfpc\r\n- July 2012: pdfpc 3.1.1 released (bugfix release)\r\n- June 2012: pdfpc 3.1 released\r\n- May 2012: pdfpc 3.0 released\r\n\r\n# Getting pdfpc\r\n\r\n## Compiling from source\r\n\r\nIn order to compile and run pdfpc the following requirements need to be met:\r\n\r\n- CMake Version >=2.6\r\n- Gtk+ 3.x\r\n- libPoppler with glib bindings\r\n- gstreamer\r\n\r\n## Compile and install\r\nDownload pdfpc-3.1.1.tgz. Uncompress the tarball (we use v3.1.1 as an example here)\r\n\r\n    tar xvf pdfpc-3.1.1.tgz\r\n\r\nChange to the extracted directory::\r\n\r\n    cd pdfpc-3.1.1\r\n\r\n## Compile and install::\r\n\r\n    cmake .\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nIf there are no errors in the process, you just installed pdfpc on your system. Congratulations! If there were errors, they are probably due to missing dependencies. Please check that you have all the necessary libraries (in some distributions you may have to install *-devel packages).\r\n\r\nNote: You may alter the final installation prefix in the cmake call. By default the pdfpc files will be installed under /usr/local/. If you want to change that, for example to be installed under /usr/, with config files under /etc/ you may specify another installation prefix as follows:\r\n\r\n    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DSYSCONFDIR=/etc .\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\nIf you use Arch Linux, you can download the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pdfpc).\r\n\r\nIf you use Debian or Ubuntu, you can install it from the repository. Older releases of Debian/Ubuntu generally come with an older version of pdfpc, or (in the case of Debian squeeze or Ubuntu precise) with the original pdf-presenter-console by Jakob Westhoff.\r\n\r\n    apt-get install pdf-presenter-console\r\n\r\nYou can also get the bleeding-edge version from github (or [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pdfpc-git)). For compiling the git version, follow the instructions given in the github page.\r\n\r\n# Config files\r\n\r\nThe keybindings of pdfpc can be customized by writing a config file, see the man page for details.\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\n\r\npdfpc is a fork of a fork of [pdf presenter console](http://westhoffswelt.de/projects/pdf_presenter_console.html) by Jakob Westhoff and David Vilar's [pdfpc](http://davvil.github.io/pdfpc/), extended with additional features.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
