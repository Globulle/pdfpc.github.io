SYNOPSIS
       pdfpc [options] PDF-file


DESCRIPTION
       pdfpc is a GTK based presentation viewer application which uses Keynote like multi-monitor output to provide meta information to the speaker during the presenta‐
       tion.  It is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen, while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other one providing information  like  a
       picture  of  the  next slide, as well as the left over time till the end of the presentation.  The input files processed by pdfpc are PDF documents, which can be
       created using nearly any of today's presentation software.

       To run pdfppc, simply type

              pdfpc file.pdf

       By default the presenter view appears in the primary monitor and the presentation view in the second monitor (provided you have two monitors).  If  you  want  to
       switch displays, start with the -s option (see below).


OPTIONS
       -d, --duration=N
              Duration in minutes of the presentation used for timer display. If not given or if a value of 0 is specified, the clock just measures the time in the pre‐
              sentation.

       -e, --end-time=T
              End time of the presentation. (Format: HH:MM (24h))

       -l, --last-minutes=N
              Time in minutes, from which on the timer changes its color. (Default 5 minutes)

       -t, --start-time=T
              Start time of the presentation to be used as a countdown. (Format: HH:MM (24h))

       -u, --current-size=N
              Percentage of the presenter screen to be used for the current slide.  (Default 60)

       -o, --overview-min-size=N
              Minimum width for the overview miniatures, in pixels. (Default 150)

       -s, --switch-screens
              Switch the presentation and the presenter screen.

       -c, --disable-cache
              Disable caching and pre-rendering of slides to save memory at the cost of speed.

       -z, --disable-compression
              Disable the compression of slide images to trade memory consumption for speed.  (Avg.  factor 30)

       -b, --black-on-end
              Add an additional black slide at the end of the presentation

       -S, --single-screen
       -h, --help
              Shows the help


KEYBINDINGS
       These are the default keybindings for pdfpc:

       Right cursor key / Page down / Return / Space / Left mouse button
              Go forward one slide

       Shift + Right cursor key / Page down / Return / Space / Left mouse button / Mouse wheel down or right
              Go forward 10 slides

       Down cursor key
              Go forward one user slide (see Overlays below)

       Left cursor key / Page up / Right mouse button / Mouse wheel up or left
              Go back one slide

       Shift + Left cursor key / Page up / Right mouse button
              Go back 10 slides

       Up cursor key
              Go back one "user slide" (see Overlays below)

       Home   Go to the first slide

       End    Go to the last slide

       Backspace
              Go back in history. Note that history is defined by "jump" commands, not by normal slide movement.

       Tab / Middle mouse button
              Overview mode

       g      Input a slide number to jump to

       Escape / q
              Exit pdfpc

       b      Turn off the presentation view (i.e.  fill it with a black color)

       n      Edit note for current slide

       f      Freeze the current presentation display (the presenter display is still fully active)

       o      Toggle the overlay flag for one particular slide (see Overlays below)

       p      Pause timer

       r      Reset presentation (reset timer and go back to first slide)

   Cache compression
       The  pre-rendered  and  cached slides can be compressed in memory to save up some memory.  Without compression a set of about 100 pdf pages can easily grow up to
       about 1.5gb size.  Netbooks with only 1gb of memory would swap themselves to death if pre-rendering is enabled in such a situation.  The compression  is  enabled
       by  default  as  it  does not harm rendering speed in a noticeable way on most systems.  It does however slow down prerendering by about a factor of two.  If you
       have got enough memory and want to ensure the fastest possible pre-rendering you can disable slide compression by using the -z switch. But be  warned  using  the
       uncompressed pre-rendering storage will use about 30 times the memory the new compressed storage utilizes (aka the 1.5gb become about 50mb)


   Timer
       If  a  duration is given (-d option), the timer will show a countdown with the given parameters.  If no duration is specified (or if a value of 0 is given to the
       -d option), the timer will show how much time has been spent.  The duration is stored automatically, so you do not need to repeat it for every invocation.

       The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for the first time.  This feature is quite useful as you may want to show  the  titlepage  of
       your  presentation  while people are still entering the room and the presentation hasn't really begun yet.  If you want to start over you can use the r key which
       will make the presenter reset the timer.

       If a duration is given, at the moment the timer reaches the defined last-minutes value it will change color to indicate your talk is nearing its end.  As soon as
       the  timer  reaches  the zero mark (00:00:00) it will turn red and count further down showing a negative time, to provide information on how many minutes you are
       overtime.


   Notes
       Textual notes can be displayed for each slide.  While in the presentation, pressing n will allow you to take notes for the screen.  To go out  of  editing  mode,
       press the Escape key.  Note that while editing a note the keybindings stop working, i.e.  you are not able to change slides.

       The notes are stored in the given file in a plain text format, easy to edit also from outside the program.  See the section about the pdfpc format below.


   Overview mode
       Pressing  tab  you  can enter the overview mode, where miniatures for the slides are shown.  You can select one slide to jump to with the mouse or with the arrow
       keys.  You can also define overlays and the end slide (see next sections) in this mode.


   Overlays
       Many slide preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e.  sets of slides that are logically grouped together as a single, changing slide.  Examples  include  enu‐
       merations  where the single items are displayed one after another or rough "animations", where parts of a picture change from slide to slide.  Pdf Presenter Con‐
       sole includes facilities for dealing with such overlays.

       In this description, we will differentiate between slides (i.e.  pages in the pdf document) and "user slides", that are the logical slides.  The standard forward
       movement  command (page down, enter, etc.) moves through one slide at a time, as expected.  That means that every step in the overlay is traversed.  The backward
       movement command works differently depending if the current and previous slides are part of an overlay:


       · If the current slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previous slide.  That means that we are in the middle of an overlay  we  can  jump  forward  and
         backward through the single steps of it

       · If  the  current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first one), but the previous slides are, we jump to the previous user slide.  This means that
         when going back in the presentation you do not have to go through every step of the overlay, Pdf Presenter Console just shows the first slide of the each over‐
         lay.  As you normally only go back in a presentation when looking for a concrete slide, this is more convenient.

       The  up  and  down  cursor  keys work on a user slide basis.  You can use them to skip the rest of an overlay or to jump to the previous user slide, ignoring the
       state of the current slide.

   pdfpc Files
       The notes and other additional information are stored in a file with the extension "pdfpc".  When invoking Pdf Presenter Console with a non pdfpc file, it  auto‐
       matically  checks if there exists such a file and in this case loads the additional information.  This means that you normally do not have to deal with this kind
       of files explicitly.

       There are however cases where you may want to edit the files manually.  The most typical case is if you add or remove some slides after you have edited notes  or
       defined  overlays.  It may be quicker to edit the pdfpc file than to re-enter the whole information.  Future versions may include external tools for dealing with
       this case automatically.

       The files are plain-text files that should be fairly self-explanatory.  A couple of things to note:

       · The slide numbers of the notes refer to user slides

       · The [notes] sections must be the last one in the file

       · For the programmers out there: slide indexes start at 1

CONFIG FILE
       The main configuration file for pdfpc is located in /usr/local/etc/pdfpcrc.  Additionally, $HOME/.pdfpcrc is  also  read,  if  present.  Following  commands  are
       aceepted

       bind &lt;key&gt; &lt;func&gt;
              Bind a key to a function

       unbind &lt;key&gt;
              Unbinds the given key

       unbind_all
              Unbinds all the keybindings

       mouse &lt;button&gt; &lt;func&gt;
              Binds a mouse button to a function

       unmouse &lt;button&gt;
              Unbinds a mouse button

       unmouse_all
              Unbinds all the mouse bindings

       switch-screens
              Switches screens, in the same way as the command line parameter with the same name.

       Key names can be obtained with the help of the xev utility. Note that names are case sensitive. Modifiers can be specified in the form &lt;mod&gt;+&lt;key&gt; where &lt;mod&gt; is
       one of S (for shift), C (for control) and A/M (for Alt/Meta). E.g.

       bind S+Next    next10

       A list of all possible functions can be obtained via the -L command line option.

       Some configuration files for commonly used devices (wireless presenters, bluetooth headsets, ...)   are  available  ⟨http://pdfpc.github.com/pdfpc#configs⟩.   If
       your device is not yet supported and you generated a working config file, please contribute it (see contact information below).

              \usepackage{hyperref}
              \href{run:&lt;movie file&gt;}{&lt;placeholder content&gt;}

       The movie will playback in the area taken by the placeholder content.  Using a frame of the movie will ensure the correct aspect ratio.


BUGS
       There may be a small memory leak in the program. I am trying to solve it. It should not be too important for up to some hundreds of slides.

       Other bugs can be reported at the issue tracker ⟨https://github.com/pdfpc/pdfpc/issues⟩.
