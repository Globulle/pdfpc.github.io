<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>pdfpc</B> [options] PDF-file



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       pdfpc is a GTK-based presentation viewer which uses Keynote-like multi-
       monitor output to provide meta information to the  speaker  during  the
       presentation.  It  is  able to show a normal presentation window on one
       screen while showing a more sophisticated overview on  the  other  one,
       providing  information like a picture of the next slide, as well as the
       time left in the presentation. pdfpc processes PDF documents, which can
       be created using nearly all modern presentation software.

       By  default  the  presenter view appears in the primary monitor and the
       presentation view in the second monitor (provided you  have  two  moni-
       tors).

</PRE>
<H2>FEATURES</H2><PRE>
   <B>Caching</B> <B>/</B> <B>Pre-rendering</B>
       To allow fast changes between the different slides of the  presentation
       the PDF pages are pre-rendered to memory.  The progress bar on the bot-
       tom of the presenter screen indicates how many percent  of  the  slides
       have  been  pre-rendered  already.   During the initial rendering phase
       this will slow down slide changes, as most CPU power is  used  for  the
       rendering  process  in the background.  After the cache is fully primed
       however the changing of slides should be much faster,  as  with  normal
       PDF viewers.


       As the pre-rendering takes a lot of memory it can be disabled using the
       --disable-cache switch at the cost of speed.


       can disable slide compression by using the -z  switch.  But  be  warned
       using  the  uncompressed  pre-rendering storage will use about 30 times
       the memory the new compressed storage utilizes (e.g. 50 MB will  become
       about 1.5 GB).


   <B>Timer</B>
       If  a  duration  is  given (-d option), the timer will show a countdown
       with the given parameters.  If no duration is specified (or if a  value
       of  0 is given to the -d option), the timer will show how much time has
       been spent.  The duration is stored automatically, so you do  not  need
       to repeat it for every invocation.


       The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for
       the first time.  This feature is quite useful as you may want  to  show
       the title page of your presentation while people are still entering the
       room and the presentation has not really begun yet.   If  you  want  to
       start  over you can use the 'r' key which will make the presenter reset
       the timer.


       If a duration is given, at the moment the  timer  reaches  the  defined
       last-minutes  value it will change color to indicate your talk is near-
       ing its end.  As soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00)  it
       will  turn  red and count further down showing a negative time, to pro-
       vide information on how many minutes you are overtime.


   <B>Notes</B>
       Textual notes can be displayed for each slide.  While in the  presenta-
       tion,  pressing 'n' will allow you to take notes for the screen.  To go
       out of editing mode, press the Escape key.  Note that while  editing  a
       note  the  keybindings  stop  working, i.e.  you are not able to change
       slides.


       The notes are stored in the given file in a plain text format, easy  to
       edit  also  from  outside the program.  See the section about the pdfpc
       format below.


   <B>Overview</B> <B>mode</B>
       Pressing tab you can enter the overview mode, where miniatures for  the
       slides  are  shown.  You can select one slide to jump to with the mouse
       or with the arrow keys.  You can also define overlays and the end slide
       (see next sections) in this mode.


   <B>Overlays</B>
       Many slide preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e.  sets of slides
       that are logically grouped together as a single, changing slide.  Exam-

       <B>o</B> If the current slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previ-
         ous slide.  That means that we are in the middle of an overlay we can
         jump forward and backward through the single steps of it

       <B>o</B> If the current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first
         one),  but  the  previous  slides  are,  we jump to the previous user
         slide.  This means that when going back in the  presentation  you  do
         not  have  to  go through every step of the overlay, pdfpc just shows
         the first slide of the each overlay.  As you normally only go back in
         a presentation when looking for a concrete slide, this is more conve-
         nient.


       The up and down cursor keys work on a user slide basis.   You  can  use
       them  to  skip  the  rest of an overlay or to jump to the previous user
       slide, ignoring the state of the current slide.


       When going through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated
       in  the  presenter view, just below the main view, showing the next and
       the previous slide in an overlay.


       Pdfpc tries to find these overlays automatically by  looking  into  the
       page  labels  in the PDF file.  For LaTeX this works correctly at least
       with the beamer class and also  modifying  the  page  numbers  manually
       (compiling  with  pdflatex).   If your preferred slide-producing method
       does not work correctly with this detection, you can supply this infor-
       mation  using  the  'o'  key  for each slide that is part of an overlay
       (except the first one!).  The page numbering  is  also  adapted.   This
       information is automatically stored.


   <B>End</B> <B>slide</B>
       Some  people like to have some additional, backup slides after the last
       slide in the actual presentation.  Things like bibliographic references
       or  slides  referring  to  specialized  questions are typical examples.
       Pdfpc lets you define which is the last slide in the  actual  presenta-
       tion  via  the  'e' key.  This just changes the progress display in the
       presenter screen, as to have a better overview of how many  slides  are
       left.


   <B>Movies</B>
       Pdfpc  can  play  back  movies included in the PDF file.  Movies may be
       started and stopped by clicking within their area.  For the  presenter,
       a  progress  bar  is drawn along the bottom of the movie.  This expands
       when the mouse hovers over it, allowing one  to  seek  by  clicking  or
       dragging within the progress bar.  Switching slides automatically stops
       playback, and movies will be reset after leaving  and  returning  to  a
       slide.
       "movie.avi?autostart&amp;loop&amp;noprogress" will  add  a  video  that  starts
       playing automatically, loops when it reaches the end, and does not show
       the progress bar.)

       In LaTeX, such links are created with

              \usepackage{hyperref}
              \href{run:&lt;movie file&gt;}{&lt;placeholder content&gt;}


       The movie will playback in the area taken by the  placeholder  content.
       Using a frame of the movie will ensure the correct aspect ratio.


       See  our  website &lt;http://pdfpc.github.io/demo/pdfpc-video-example.zip&gt;
       for a full example.


   <B>Pointer</B> <B>Mode</B>
       If needed it is possible to turn on a pointer which draws a red dot  in
       the  place pointed by mouse cursor on both - presenter and presentation
       screens.  It is also possible to  increase  and  decrease  the  pointer
       size. Additionally when the pointer is enabled it is possible to drag &amp;
       drop some area of the presenter screen causing it to be highlighted  in
       both views as well. Area outside the selected region will be dimmed.


   <B>pdfpc</B> <B>Files</B>
       The  notes  and  other additional information are stored in a file with
       the extension "pdfpc".  When pdfpc is invoked with a PDF file, it auto-
       matically checks for and loads the associated pdfpc file, if it exists.
       This means that you normally do not have to  deal  with  this  kind  of
       files explicitly.

       There  are however cases where you may want to edit the files manually.
       The most typical case is if you add or remove  some  slides  after  you
       have  edited  notes or defined overlays.  It may be quicker to edit the
       pdfpc file than to re-enter the whole information.  Future versions may
       include external tools for dealing with this case automatically.

       The  files are plain-text files that should be fairly self-explanatory.
       A couple of things to note:

       <B>o</B> The slide numbers of the notes refer to user slides

       <B>o</B> The [notes] sections must be the last one in the file

       <B>o</B> For the programmers out there: slide indexes start at 1


   <B>Appearance</B>
       With GTK3 it is possible to modify the appearance of pdfpc.  There  are
       it. It should not be too important for up to some hundreds of slides.

       There are several other programs with similar functionality.

       <B>impressive(1)</B> has nice transition effects.

       <B>hpdfp(1)</B> is the Haskell PDF Presenter &lt;http://michaeldadams.org/
       projects/haskell-pdf-presenter/&gt;  program, which packs an amazing level
       of functionality into not many lines of Haskell.

       <B>pympress(1)</B> is a little PDF reader written in Python &lt;https://
       github.com/Cimbali/pympress&gt;  which  handles  dual  screens  and beamer
       notes.

       <B>dspdfviewer(1)</B> is also specialized for beamer-produced  wide  PDF  with
       notes.

       Many PDF viewers have full-screen presentation modes, but without dual-
       monitor  preview  or  notes  or  a  timer.  These  include  <B>zathura(1)</B>,
       <B>evince(1)</B>, and <B>okular(1)</B>.
