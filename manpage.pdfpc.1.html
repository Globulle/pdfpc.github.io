<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>pdfpc</B> [options] PDF-file



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       pdfpc is a GTK-based presentation viewer which uses Keynote-like multi-
       monitor output to provide meta information to the  speaker  during  the
       presentation.  It  is  able to show a normal presentation window on one
       screen while showing a more sophisticated overview on  the  other  one,
       providing  information like a picture of the next slide, as well as the
       time left in the presentation. pdfpc processes PDF documents, which can
       be created using nearly all modern presentation software.

       By  default  the  presenter view appears in the primary monitor and the
       presentation view in the second monitor (provided you  have  two  moni-
       tors).

</PRE>
<H2>FEATURES</H2><PRE>
   <B>Caching</B> <B>/</B> <B>Pre-rendering</B>
       To  allow fast changes between the different slides of the presentation
       the PDF pages are pre-rendered to memory.  The progress bar on the bot-
       tom  of  the  presenter screen indicates how many percent of the slides
       have been pre-rendered already.  During  the  initial  rendering  phase
       this  will  slow  down slide changes, as most CPU power is used for the
       rendering process in the background.  After the cache is  fully  primed
       however  the  changing  of slides should be much faster, as with normal
       PDF viewers.


       situation.   The  compression is enabled by default as it does not harm
       rendering speed in a noticeable way on most systems.  It  does  however
       slow  down  pre-rendering  by  about  a factor of two.  If you have got
       enough memory and want to ensure the fastest possible pre-rendering you
       can  disable  slide  compression  by using the -z switch. But be warned
       using the uncompressed pre-rendering storage will use  about  30  times
       the  memory the new compressed storage utilizes (e.g. 50 MB will become
       about 1.5 GB).


   <B>Timer</B>
       If a duration is given (-d option), the timer  will  show  a  countdown
       with  the given parameters.  If no duration is specified (or if a value
       of 0 is given to the -d option), the timer will show how much time  has
       been  spent.   The duration is stored automatically, so you do not need
       to repeat it for every invocation.


       The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for
       the  first  time.  This feature is quite useful as you may want to show
       the title page of your presentation while people are still entering the
       room  and  the  presentation  has not really begun yet.  If you want to
       start over you can use the 'r' key which will make the presenter  reset
       the timer.


       If  a  duration  is  given, at the moment the timer reaches the defined
       last-minutes value it will change color to indicate your talk is  near-
       ing  its end.  As soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00) it
       will turn red and count further down showing a negative time,  to  pro-
       vide information on how many minutes you are overtime.


   <B>Notes</B>
       Textual  notes can be displayed for each slide.  While in the presenta-
       tion, pressing 'n' will allow you to take notes for the screen.  To  go
       out  of  editing mode, press the Escape key.  Note that while editing a
       note the keybindings stop working, i.e.  you are  not  able  to  change
       slides.


       The  notes are stored in the given file in a plain text format, easy to
       edit also from outside the program.  See the section  about  the  pdfpc
       format below.


   <B>Overview</B> <B>mode</B>
       Pressing  tab you can enter the overview mode, where miniatures for the
       slides are shown.  You can select one slide to jump to with  the  mouse
       or with the arrow keys.  You can also define overlays and the end slide
       (see next sections) in this mode.

       in  the overlay is traversed.  The backward movement command works dif-
       ferently depending if the current and previous slides are  part  of  an
       overlay:


       <B>o</B> If the current slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previ-
         ous slide.  That means that we are in the middle of an overlay we can
         jump forward and backward through the single steps of it

       <B>o</B> If the current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first
         one), but the previous slides are,  we  jump  to  the  previous  user
         slide.   This  means  that when going back in the presentation you do
         not have to go through every step of the overlay,  pdfpc  just  shows
         the first slide of the each overlay.  As you normally only go back in
         a presentation when looking for a concrete slide, this is more conve-
         nient.


       The  up  and  down cursor keys work on a user slide basis.  You can use
       them to skip the rest of an overlay or to jump  to  the  previous  user
       slide, ignoring the state of the current slide.


       When going through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated
       in the presenter view, just below the main view, showing the  next  and
       the previous slide in an overlay.


       Pdfpc  tries  to  find these overlays automatically by looking into the
       page labels in the PDF file.  For LaTeX this works correctly  at  least
       with  the  beamer  class  and  also modifying the page numbers manually
       (compiling with pdflatex).  If your  preferred  slide-producing  method
       does not work correctly with this detection, you can supply this infor-
       mation using the 'o' key for each slide that  is  part  of  an  overlay
       (except  the  first  one!).   The page numbering is also adapted.  This
       information is automatically stored.


   <B>End</B> <B>slide</B>
       Some people like to have some additional, backup slides after the  last
       slide in the actual presentation.  Things like bibliographic references
       or slides referring to  specialized  questions  are  typical  examples.
       Pdfpc  lets  you define which is the last slide in the actual presenta-
       tion via the 'e' key.  This just changes the progress  display  in  the
       presenter  screen,  as to have a better overview of how many slides are
       left.


   <B>Movies</B>
       Pdfpc can play back movies included in the PDF  file.   Movies  may  be
       started  and stopped by clicking within their area.  For the presenter,
       a progress bar is drawn along the bottom of the  movie.   This  expands
       As  a perhaps simpler option, pdfpc will play back movies linked from a
       hyperlink of type "launch".  A query string may be added to the URL  of
       the  movie  to  enable the "autostart", "loop" and "noprogress" proper-
       ties,      if      necessary.        (E.g.,       a       link       to
       "movie.avi?autostart&amp;loop&amp;noprogress"  will  add  a  video  that starts
       playing automatically, loops when it reaches the end, and does not show
       the progress bar.)

       In LaTeX, such links are created with

              \usepackage{hyperref}
              \href{run:&lt;movie file&gt;}{&lt;placeholder content&gt;}


       The  movie  will playback in the area taken by the placeholder content.
       Using a frame of the movie will ensure the correct aspect ratio.


       See our  website  &lt;http://pdfpc.github.io/demo/pdfpc-video-example.zip&gt;
       for a full example.


   <B>Pointer</B> <B>Mode</B>
       If  needed it is possible to turn on a pointer which draws a red dot in
       the place pointed by mouse cursor on both - presenter and  presentation
       screens.   It  is  also  possible  to increase and decrease the pointer
       size. Additionally when the pointer is enabled it is possible to drag &amp;
       drop  some area of the presenter screen causing it to be highlighted in
       both views as well. Area outside the selected region will be dimmed.


   <B>pdfpc</B> <B>Files</B>
       The several additional information are stored in a file with the exten-
       sion  "pdfpc".  When pdfpc is invoked with a PDF file, it automatically
       checks for and loads the associated pdfpc file,  if  it  exists.   This
       means  that  you  normally  do not have to deal with this kind of files
       explicitly.

       Beside internal configiration, the following user  contributed  command
       line options are stored within the pdfpc file for later usage:


       <B>o</B> duration

       <B>o</B> end_time

       <B>o</B> last_minutes

       <B>o</B> notes (position)

       <B>o</B> start_time


   <B>Appearance</B>
       With  GTK3  it is possible to modify the appearance of pdfpc. There are
       two locations where pdfpc is looking for files. The default location is
       @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/pixmaps/pdfpc/pdfpc.css.  A  user can copy
       it to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pdfpc/pdfpc.css and change the attributes as  he
       likes.


   <B>Integration</B> <B>with</B> <B>other</B> <B>tools</B>
       Pdfpc provides a dbus interface that other tools can use to execute any
       action listed by <B>--list-actions</B>.  The interface appears on the  session
       bus as  <I>io.github.pdfpc</I>.

       There are several other programs with similar functionality.

       <B>impressive(1)</B> has nice transition effects.

       <B>hpdfp(1)</B> is the Haskell PDF Presenter &lt;http://michaeldadams.org/
       projects/haskell-pdf-presenter/&gt;  program, which packs an amazing level
       of functionality into not many lines of Haskell.

       <B>pympress(1)</B> is a little PDF reader written in Python &lt;https://
       github.com/Cimbali/pympress&gt;  which  handles  dual  screens  and beamer
       notes.

       <B>dspdfviewer(1)</B> is also specialized for beamer-produced  wide  PDF  with
       notes.

       Many PDF viewers have full-screen presentation modes, but without dual-
       monitor  preview  or  notes  or  a  timer.  These  include  <B>zathura(1)</B>,
